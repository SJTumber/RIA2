* getTissue
** calculate the max and min values from EDM & Skeleton
- we were previously using the histogram function imagej but this
  gives incorrect max and min pixel values, so we do the whole scan
  ourselves
- the tissue volume is computed from the edm figures,
  i**2*pi*hist[i] where i is a particular value for the edm and
  hist[i] is the count number for that i
