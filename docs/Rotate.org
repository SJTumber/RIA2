* Rotating the image to minimize 
** helper functions
** getWH
- threshold the image
- get the roi
- get the bounds of the roi
- crop the image
- find its width and height
** getAngle
- measure getWH at each rotation angle
- whole image is rotated using bilinear interpolation from imagej
- the rotated image is then passed through getWH
- compare the height of the image is smaller than the previous height
  keep rotating the image
- the idea is that the image with smallest height is the best aligned
  image
- this method only works for root systems which are wider than tall

** lineExtent
- scan a line from left to right
- on the first black pixel that it encounters, set it to the left
  boundary
- on the last white pixel that it encounters, set it to the right
  boundary 
- the lineExtent is the diff of these two numbers (+1)
** getVolumeFromExtents
- calculate the volume by computing the area of the slice
- use lineExtent to get the diameter, then use it to compute
- d*d/4 * pi
- since each pixel is of height one, the volume is simply
  the accumulation of the all the areas above
** getVolume
- same a getVolumeFromExtents but we rotate the image first
- this is necessary because the unaligned images have incorrect
  radial thinning as calculated with the volume from line extent
